# Makefile documentation  

## Response:
Based on the Makefile you've provided, I'll create a concise development guide. This Makefile is designed for a Python project and includes tasks for setting up a development environment, building Docker images, deploying with Kubernetes, running the application, managing dependencies, and generating documentation.

### Development Guide Overview

1. **Initial Setup**: Ensure Python and Docker are installed on your system. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. **Environment Setup**:

   * Create a virtual environment using the `make venv` command. This isolates your project dependencies.
   * Activate the virtual environment as directed by the Makefile output.

3. **Development**:

   * Install development dependencies and set up pre-commit hooks using `make bootstrap`.
   * Use `make dev-venv` to install the package in development mode within the virtual environment.

4. **Building Docker Images**:

   * Build a Docker image with `make build-image`. This uses the `Dockerfile` in your project directory.
   * For cached Docker builds, use `make build-cached-image`.

5. **Running the Application**:

   * Locally: Run your application using `make run`. This executes the `main.py` Python script.
   * In Docker: Use `make run-in-docker` to run your application inside a Docker container.

6. **Testing and Coverage**:

   * Run tests with `make test`. This project uses pytest for testing.
   * Generate a coverage report with `make coverage` and view it with `make view-coverage`.

7. **Deployment**:

   * Deploy your application using Kubernetes with `make deploy-app`. Ensure Kubernetes manifests are properly set up in the `kubernetes` directory.

8. **Documentation**:

   * Generate project documentation using Sphinx with `make docs` for HTML documentation or `make pdf-doc` for PDF documentation.

9. **Cleanup**:

   * Clean up project artifacts using `make clean`. This includes removing build artifacts, Docker images, and Python bytecode files.

10. **Code Style and Linting**:

  * Ensure code quality with `make lint` for style checks and `make formatter` for code formatting.

This guide is a simplified overview. Each command and its purpose is derived from your Makefile, aiming to streamline your development workflow. For detailed explanations and additional options, refer to the comments and definitions within your Makefile.
